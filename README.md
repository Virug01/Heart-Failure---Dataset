## Introduction
This project aims to explore and analyze heart failure data to understand the factors that contribute to heart failure and visualize the distribution and relationships of these factors.

## Data Importing
The initial step involves importing the dataset and necessary libraries for analysis.

## Numeric Data Analysis
In this section, we perform a detailed analysis of the numeric features present in the dataset.

## Categorical Data Analysis
### By Pie Chart
We visualize the distribution of categorical variables using pie charts.

## Violin Plot Analysis
We use violin plots to visualize the distribution and density of numeric variables across different categories.

## Conclusion
This section summarizes the findings from the exploratory data analysis and potential insights about heart failure.
